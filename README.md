# Blueprint

This project serves as the blueprint of our new world: BitWorld. 

## Design
- BitWorld is a replica of the real world, there are cities, schools, movie theatres, restaurants, hospitals, and everything you can see in the real world here. 
- All bit human beings share the same BitWorld, however, they may not see each other in this world. 
- Bitcoin is the currency in BitWorld. 
- Bit male and female can mate and give birth to bit children, it costs bitcoin to raise a bit child. 
- BitWorld is shared by all human beings of the real world. No single person can take control of BitWorld. If such a being exits, he/she shall be expeled by votes of bit human beings. 

## TODOs
- Create the currency system of BitWorld. 
- Create the world map. 
- Create the seed bit human.
